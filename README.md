# Countries Data Visualization Project


This project aims to visualize data from the REST Countries API while providing users with a convenient color theme switcher. This is my first project on the Frontend Mentor website. Based on the given design, this project attempts to allow users to search for countries and filter them by region. I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this interactive web application.
